## :beginner: Project goal
The goal of this personal project is to familiarize myself with web scraping.

This code scans a website with  one piece episode. 
It then informs me if new episodes are available.

# :wrench: Future developments
  - Add confirmation button to inform the program that I have read the new episode
  - Add a function to generalize to different websites/other episode genres##  :camera: Gallery
